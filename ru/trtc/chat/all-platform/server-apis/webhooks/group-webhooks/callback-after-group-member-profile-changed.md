# Callback After Group Member Profile Changed

## Feature Overview

The app backend can real-time view the changes in group member information (group member identity, group card) through this callback, and perform operations such as data synchronization based on it.

## Notes

- To enable the callback, you must configure a callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol switch. For detailed configuration methods, see [Third-party Callback Configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34520) document.
- During this callback, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is consistent with its own SDKAppID.
- For other security-related matters, please refer to [Introduction to Third-party Callback - Security Considerations](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34354#.E5.AE.89.E5.85.A8.E8.80.83.E8.99.91).

## Scenarios that may trigger this callback

- App users modify group member information through the client.
- App admins modify group member profiles through RESTful APIs.

## Callback Trigger Time

After successfully modifying group member profiles.

### Response packet example

Following data synchronization, the app backend dispatches a callback response packet.

```
{    "ActionStatus": "OK",    "ErrorInfo": "",    "ErrorCode": 0 // Ignore callback result}
```

### Response packet field description

| Field | Type | Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
